clsBasins.GetData(Query As IXMLDOMDocument, Result As IXMLDOMDocument) As Boolean

find values for basins_dir, project_dir, cache_dir, all ending with \

Parse Query to find which types are requested of core, dem, demg, ned, giras
  (make subdirectories if needed for the desired types)

find value for base_url, ending with /

find values for URL suffixes for possible types of data to download

create a nodStatus part of Result and indicate that the operation is not yet complete

for each HUC specified in Query, download and process the requested data types
  processing downloaded data is different for different types:
  core: 1. merge the downloaded DBFs that are not part of shape files into the
           corresponding DBFs in the project directory, 
        2. add an instruction to project and merge the downloaded shape files. 
        (This instruction will be followed after all downloading is finished.)
  dem: add XML instruction to project, merge, and add the downloaded shape file 
       to the project.
  giras: add an instruction to project and merge the downloaded shape files. 
  demg, ned: no special processing after each HUC

If core data was downloaded and this run is designated as a "BasinsInitialSetup,"
  (currently the ArcView portion of BASINS designates this when appropriate)
  then some files included in the national project are copied and a new ArcView 
  project is built using BASINSArchive.

If DEM, NED, or DEMG was downloaded, instructions are given for importing them 
into the ArcView project.

If the process is not cancelled, nodStatus is updated to indicate completion 
as the function finishes.

clsPCSDischarge.GetData

find values for project_dir and cache_dir, ending with \

find value for base_url, ending with ?

create a nodStatus part of Result and indicate that the operation is not yet complete

for each PCS site (enumerated by NPDES #)
  (commented-out code for retrieving PCS_CUR_DMR_MEASUREMENT)

  retrieve PCS_DMR_MEASUREMENT comma-separated values file
    PCS data is stored in the BASINS project as DBF files named by HUC
    open, create, or find already opened destination DBF for this station
    open the CSV just downloaded and import it into the DBF

summarize the stations that did not have data (in PCS_DischargeNoData.txt)

save the opened DBFs back to disk
