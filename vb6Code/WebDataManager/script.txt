During development of the download tool, web sites providing data
have changed in ways that require changes in the download tool. A
solution to this maintenance problem will be found.

There are three dimensions to the possible solutions: who updates
the download tool when a web site changes, what programming
language they use, and how updates are propagated.

Who updates the tool when a website changes? 
  end users: 
        pro: doesn't require Aqua Terra or EPA to be involved
             might be faster than waiting for someone to do it
        con: duplicated effort if more than one user fixes it 
             requires end users to be programmers

 Aqua Terra:
        pro: no changes required to existing code
             no additional documentation of existing code
             nobody new has to learn the internals of the tool
             no duplication of effort
        con: requires continuing maintainance contract

        EPA:
        pro: no duplication of effort
        con: somebody new has to learn how the tool works        

What programming language? Visual Basic or scripting language?

We could extend our existing scripting language to allow
downloading web data. When current download tool components are
translated into the scripting language and documented, this would
allow users to update downloading scripts without a copy of Visual
Basic. Some of the most generic details of downloading that do not
change over time (displaying progress for example) could be hidden
while exposing all the differences between web sites in scripts.

Extending the script language to support downloading data would
not be very difficult, but translating all the currently available
downloable data types into scripts would take considerable effort.

While this would skip the need for a copy of VB and hide some
details, the scripting language is still a programming language
and really requires a programmer to make more than the smallest
change.

If we continue to use VB and not the script language, we could
provide documentation of the downloading modules and hints for how
they might need to be edited. Any person who understands VB could
then make the needed changes.

Another solution would be to use the existing VB code, but make it
look for strings (in the registry or a text file) that could
override defaults for situations where a machine name changes but
all the logic of constructing URLs stays the same. This could
allow users to make the simple changes and leave complicated
changes to programmers.

How are updates propagated?

Currently, the whole program is distributed normally and updates
are available by installing a whole new version of BASINS or at
least of GenScn/WinHSPF/WDMUtil. Since the download tool is unique
in having a need for quick updates, we should consider another
method of updating this tool.

Currently the main parts to the tool are:

cURL.exe: a freely available command-line program that performs
          the core action of downloading from the web to a file
          http://curl.sourceforge.net/

WebDataManager.dll: 
          The central library containing generic code for
          selecting data types, specifying locations, calling cURL,
          and displaying progress

DataDownload.exe: a very thin wrapper around WebDataManager.dll

ATCWebData*.dll:
          Each web site and each type of data has a component
          responsible for requesting that data and doing any
          desired post-processing.

We could provide a method for the download tool to check for
new and updated versions of ATCWebData*.dll, probably in the same
place BASINS is available for download. If we go to a script-based
architecture, the same scheme could search for new and updated
scripts rather than DLLs.


Musings on conversion to a script architecture follow. Possibly
only meaningful to Mark.

Essential parts of each data type:

What does it provide?
  file format tgz
  file format csv
  file format rdb
  XML npdes 
      "name", "NPDES #"
      "type", "string"
      "selected", "true"
  XML storetstation
      "name", "Storet Station"
      "type", "string"
      "selected", "true"
  XML storetlegacystation
      "name", "Legacy Storet Station"
      "type", "string"

What does it need to know?
  save_dir
  huc_cd
  state_nlcd
  site_no
  SHPfilename
  WDMfilename
  storetlegacystation "multiple", "true"

  for USGS stations, any one of:

  "state_abbrev"
    "type", "State"
    "multiple", "true"
    "label", "State Abbreviation"
  "state_fips"
    "type", "State"
    "multiple", "true"
    "label", "State FIPS Code"
  "huc_2"
    "multiple", "true"
    "label", "2-digit HUC"
  "huc_cd"
    "multiple", "true"
    "label", "8-digit HUC"  

How to get the data?

  First, we need the obvious new token: (Download URL SaveAs Caption)
  That would only take an hour or so since we already have the body.

  Then we would need to rewrite all twelve of our GetData routines
  currently in VB to use script language.

  NHD would be easy, it is only a couple of lines long now so it
  would take a few minutes to create a script. Most of the other
  ones are a lot harder, requiring more than one Download and
  parsing of strings with InStr and Mid and checking for errors
  and looping for each HUC or station ID. 

  The main new thing we would need is an interface to select which
  data to download. Our current script interface for specifying
  values for arguments is not sufficient because it only allows
  one string value for each argument. At the least we would have
  to extend this to allow entering several HUCs or station IDs.
  It would also be nice to have a selection of one or more kinds
  of data to download before anything else.

  We may need a new token that can generate a custom script based
  on available data download scripts. The "main" script might then
  be: 

  (ATCScript "Select Data to Download"
             (SelectData)
  )

  The SelectData token would search for available download scripts
  and create a selection script like:

  (ATCScript "Select And Download Data"
             (Arg "DataTypes" 
                  "USGS Daily,USGS WQ" --- These might be remembered in the registry as the previous selections
                  "UsgsDaily,UsgsSite,BasinsProject,NLCD,NHD,EPAPCSFacility,EPAPCSPermit,EPAPCSDischarge,StoretStatn,StoretVisit,StorLstatn,StorLdata,UsgsWQ" 
                  "Which data do you wish to download?")
             (For DataSelected in DataTypes
                (Set ArgList (MergeArgs ArgList DataSelected))
                (Set GetData (+ GetData CR "(" DataSelected ")"))
             )
             (RunScript (+ "(ATCScript Generated " ArgList GetData)))
  )

  
  I can imagine that GetSetting and SaveSetting will be convenient
  new tokens for saving defaults.
