Site and Initial Condition Input Variables
USic: Snow energy content : Initial value of energy content state variable giving the energy content of the snow pack plus thermally active soil per unit of horizontal area defined with respect to solid (ice) phase snow at 0 ˚C. : "kJ/m^2"

apr: Atmospheric pressure : Atmospheric pressure of a grid or a particular site.  An average is sufficient as the model uses a constant value (does not accommodate weather fluctuations) in its sensible and latent heat flux calculations. : "Pa"
0        
74051   
Aep: Albedo extinction coefficient : Depth threshold used to interpolate albedo for shallow snow. When snow depth is shallower than apr, albedo is interpolated between snow value and substrate value. This should reflect the surface roughness or shrub height in combination with penetration depth of solar radiation into snow. : "m"
