ÿ2This spreadsheet has been prepared as a tool for use in land management and soil conservation at the Hydrologic Cataloging Unit (HUC-8) level.  The HUC-8s of interest are selected from a digital map of the United States located on the ensuing tab.  The selected HUC-8s are then automatically entered into the chart located on the third tab.  Each HUC-8 can be divided into common land groupings as defined by use, management practices, soil type, and topography.  The Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) is employed to estimate edge-of-field sediment loads for each unique land grouping.  Finally, the edge-of-field loads are multiplied by delivery ratios and summed to estimate the total edge-of-stream load.

The original Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) was developed specifically for application to agricultural lands.  RUSLE is simply an updated version of the same formula, but each factor value in RUSLE has been updated, expanded, and improved.  RUSLE has been developed to allow for use with more than just cropland.  Other land uses to which RUSLE can be applied include rangeland, disturbed forest lands, landfills, construction sites, mining sites, reclaimed lands, military training lands, parks, land disposal of waste, and permanent grassland.

This model is applicable to sheet and rill erosion only.  It does not estimate channel erosion or compute sedimentation in receiving water bodies.  Throughout the variable selection process, the user must make intelligent, informed decisions about the particular environmental factors of the subject lands.
