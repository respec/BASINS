</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SEACAST is an integrated software system that is designed to address a number of maritime environmental emergency, transportation and coastal resource management issues. Remotely sensed data, from satellite, airborne sensors or ground-wave radars, can be ingested into the system through a data interface program.  The applications modules are stand-alone programs that provide added functionality to that contained in the circulation model, or which provide end-use data products.  SPILLSIM is an example of the former.  This module provides oil spill trajectory and fate predictions using hydrodynamics derived from the circulation model, combined with a specialized range of input/output features relevant to crude and refined petroleum products.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the core of SEACAST is a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model (C3) coupled with water quality and ecology submodels that can be applied at regional to local scales worldwide.  It is capable of predicting the hydrodynamic and thermodynamic behaviour of coastal seas, the transport and diffusion of nutrients and/or contaminants and the evolution of biological fields.  The hydrodynamics are governed by variations in ocean salinity and temperature (density), tides, wind, atmospheric pressure, runoff and low-frequency variations in sea level.  Advanced features include a Mellor-Yamada (1982) level-2 turbulence closure scheme and the Smagorinsky (1963) formulation for lateral shear stress.  The water quality model treats a range of conservative, non-conservative and partitioned contaminants, as well as bacteria, biochemical oxygen demand and dissolved oxygen, and settleable solids for single and multiple point sources.  This submodel also contains an embedded buoyant plume simulator for multiport ocean outfalls.  The ecology model is based on a lumped-species phytoplankton-zooplankton-nitrate (PZN) model (Kremer and Nixon, 1978), but may be adapted to other trophic levels as conditions warrant.  The model is fully prognostic for all variables.  The fundamental equations are solved using semi-implicit finite difference methods on uniformly spaced Cartesian grids. in all dependent variables.  Grids range from high resolution meshes with spacings of the order of 50-100 m for near-field effluent plume solutions, to 5000 m or more for open ocean continental shelf models.</P><DIR>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The current version of C3 runs on Sun Solaris.  Depending on the processor, practical run times limit the number of wet points in the horizontal grid to about 20,000 to 40,000, with 10-15 layers in the vertical.  This capability is sufficient for most problems of interest.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nutrient cycling and sediment/water nutrient exchange is not currently supported (July, 2000) but is planned within two years.  The ecology model is currently a "lumped" species model for phytoplankton and zooplankton.  An increase in the number of species can be undertaken without restriction other than run times and specification of the empirical coefficients included in the interaction processes.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Applications History</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The modelling system (SEACAST/C3) was implemented for the Juan de Fuca-Georgia-Puget Sound waterway (Washington State/British Columbia) in 1994, based on six previous years of 3-D model research and development conducted for Fisheries &amp; Oceans, Canada.  Initial applications included:</P>

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>tides and currents for oil spill response planning</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>circulation and water properties for MPA (marine protected area) planning</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>variations in primary production related to fluctuations in freshwater runoff</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>dilution/water quality for several large ocean outfalls operated by the Greater Vancouver Regional District and the Capital Regional District, British Columbia</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>sea surface temperature and red tide forecasts (1996-1998) for the Canadian western continental shelf (operational model with satellite data assimilation, real-time in situ data assimilation and wind forecast data input).</LI></P></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These applications provided verification support for the modelling system through comparisons with measured water levels, currents, advection-diffusion of dyed plumes, hydrographic properties, satellite imaging data and observations of primary production.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since 1998, the modelling system has been applied for water quality and red tide studies in Manila Bay, for tides and currents in the South China Sea and Malacca/Singapore Strait in support of oil spill modelling (SPILLIM, a linked model within the SEACAST system) and currents for sewage solids sedimentation modelling as part of designing a long-term environmental effects monitoring program.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The system is currently being evolved in the direction of risk assessment through modelling the pathways, fate and biological interaction with toxicants.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Model Use Features</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C3 is primarily intended for Seaconsult's own use.  The focus of development has been twofold: strong scientific formulation with accurate numerical solution algorithms, and rapid, convenient delivery of model results to end-use clients.  Model results are posted to client-specific web pages in a proprietary, compact format for easy download to the client's PC computer.  The client is supplied with Seainfo, a data visualization tool that can be used to view, animate and query the 3-D fields.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In some circumstances, executable copies of C3 will be licensed to end-users to allow hypothesis testing by varying input loads and boundary conditions.  Generally, Seaconsult works closely with the client during set-up, verification and training.</P>
