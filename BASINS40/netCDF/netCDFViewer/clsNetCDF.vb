'This is a wrapper class for the netCDF dll.
'
'Get the netCDF dll from ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf/contrib/win32
'Put it somewhere in your path, or else in the bin subdirectory of your
'VB project.
'
'Then include this class file in your project. Use the netcdf functions 
'like this:
'res = NetCDF.nc_create(name, NetCDF.cmode.NC_CLOBBER, ncid)
'If (res <> 0) Then GoTo err
'
'NetCDF was ported to dll by John Caron (as far as I know).
'This VB.NET wrapper created by Ed Hartnett, 3/10/4
'
'Some notes:
'   Although the dll can be tested (and has passed for release 
'3.5.0 and 3.5.1 at least), the VB wrapper class has not been
'extensively tested. Use at your own risk. Writing test code to
'test the netCDF interface is a non-trivial task, and one I haven't
'undertaken. The tests run verify common use of netCDF, for example
'creation of dims, vars, and atts of various types, and ensuring that
'they can be written and read back. But I don't check type conversion,
'or boundery conditions. These are all tested in the dll, but not the
'VB wrapper.
'
'This class consists mearly of some defined enums, consts and declares, 
'all inside a class called NetCDF.
'
'Passing strings: when passing in a string to a function, use a string,
'when passing in a pointer to a string so that the function can fill it 
'(for example when requesting an attribute name, use a 
'System.Text.StringBuilder.
'
'Since VB doesn't have an unsigned byte, I've left those functions 
'out of the wrapper class. If you need to read unsigned bytes, read them as 
'shorts, and netcdf will automatically convert them for you.
