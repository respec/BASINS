				<a NAME="interface"></a>Interface</h4>
<P>The TauDEM plugin consists of the following three menus.&nbsp;</P>
<UL>
  <LI>&nbsp;Basic Grid Analysis&nbsp; 
  <LI>&nbsp;Network Analysis&nbsp; 
  <LI>&nbsp;Specialized Grid Analysis 
  <LI>&nbsp;Utilities</LI></UL>
		  
		<p>
		Basic Grid Analysis contains the functions that are core to most basic Digital 
		Elevation Model (DEM) analyses, and provide inputs to many other 
		functions.&nbsp; The general order in which they should be executed is top to 
		bottom.
		<p>
		Network Analysis contains the functions required to delineate channel networks 
		and subwatersheds.&nbsp; Again the sequence is top to bottom.
		<p>
		Specialized Grid Analysis contains more advanced functions that can be invoked 
		as needed.
		<p>The section below on <A href="TauDEM.html#thefunctions" >the functions and what they do</A> below describes in detail how each function works.&nbsp; Generally each 
time a menu item is selected a dialog box appears showing the inputs and outputs 
for a particular function.&nbsp; Once a base DEM has been selected the file 
names for most inputs and outputs are populated following the default file 
naming convention.&nbsp; You are free to change these, but working with the 
defaults saves some typing.&nbsp; [A side 
		effect of this, is that if a new base DEM is selected, 
		all file names are reset back to their defaults.]&nbsp; Before running each function 
		you should ensure that all necessary input information exists, or expect an 
		error.&nbsp; Help on the individual files is available by clicking on 
		the label to the left of the field where file names can 
		be changed.

		<h3>
			<a NAME="thefunctions"></a>The functions and what they do</h3>
		Each function is described below.&nbsp; Optional inputs are shown in [], with 
		file name suffixes that refer to the table in the <A href="TauDEM.html#dataformats" >data 
			formats section below</A> given in ().&nbsp; <b>TauDEM assumes implicitly that 
			all grids used have the same grid cell size and extent.&nbsp;</b> This 
		assumption is checked in some places, but not consistently so where data is 
		obtained from diverse sources it needs to be converted to a consistent grid 
		cell size and extent (and the same projection) for use with TauDEM.
		<h4>
			Fill Pits</h4>
		Input:
		<ul>
			<li>
			Base Elevation grid.
			<li>
				[Flow path grid (fdr).]</li>
		</ul>
		Output:
		<ul>
			<li>
			Pit filled Elevation grid (fel).
			<li>
				[Verified flow path grid (fdrn)]</li>
		</ul>
		Method:&nbsp; This identifies all pits in the DEM and raises their elevation to 
		the level of the lowest pour point around their edge.&nbsp; Pits are low 
		elevation areas in digital elevation models (DEMs) that are completely 
		surrounded by higher terrain.&nbsp; They are generally taken to be artifacts 
		that interfere with the routing of flow across DEMs, so are removed by raising 
		their elevation to the point where they drain off the edge of the DEM.&nbsp; 
		The pour point is the lowest point on the boundary of the "watershed" draining 
		to the pit.&nbsp; This step is not essential if you have reason to believe that 
		the pits in your DEM are real.&nbsp; This step can be circumvented by copying 
		the raw DEM source data onto the file with suffix "fel" that is the output of 
		"Fill Pits".&nbsp; Also if a few isolated pits are known, but others need to be 
		filled, the isolated pits should have "no data" elevation values inserted at 
		their lowest point.&nbsp; "no data" values serve to define edges in the domain, 
		and elevations are only raised to where flow is off an edge, so an internal "no 
		data" value will stop a pit from being filled if necessary.
		<p>
		The flow path grid to enforce drainage along existing streams is an optional 
		input.&nbsp; The flow directions in the flow path grid grid take precedence 
		over flow directions determined from the DEM and where these are uphill, the 
		elevations along these flow paths are lowered, rather than upflow elevations 
		raised.&nbsp; The verified flow path grid output when the optional flow path 
		grid is used has loops and ambiguities present in the original flow path grid 
		removed.
		<p>          The enforcing of flow along 
			a flow path should be used when the stream data source is deemed to be 
			better than the DEM.&nbsp; The input flow path grid uses the D8 direction encoding, i.e. 1 - East, 
			2 - North East, 3 - North, 4 - North West, 5 - West, 6 - South West, 
			7 - South, 8 - South East. No data values indicate off 
			stream locations.&nbsp;&nbsp; The flow path grid can be created by burning in a stream 
			feature dataset using the following steps.
			<br>
			1. Convert features to raster retaining the same cell size and extent as the 
			target DEM. Call the resulting grid strgrd.
			<br>
			2. Use raster calculator to subtract a large number from each elevation value 
			that corresponds to a stream. This results in a temporary DEM with deep canyons 
			along the streams. Call the resulting grid demcanyon.
			<br>
			3. Use "Fill Pits" and "D8 flow directions" to calculate flow directions on 
			demcanyon. The flow directions calculated will be demcanyonp.
			<br>
			4. Use raster calculator to evaluate demcanyonp/strgrd. This will result in no 
			data values off the stream raster due to a divide by 0, but will retain flow 
			directions calculated on the stream raster. The convention for naming the 
			result is to use the suffix fdr. This is the grid input to the "Fill pits 
			function" to enforce stream flow directions.

				D8 Flow Directions</h4>
			Input:
			<ul>
				<li>
				Pit Filled Elevation grid.
				<li>
					[Verified flow path grid (fdrn).]</li>
			</ul>
			Output:
			<ul>
				<li>
				D8 flow direction grid (p).
				<li>
					D8 slope grid (sd8).</li>
			</ul>
			Method: The flow direction from each grid cell to one of its adjacent or 
			diagonal neighbors is calculated using steepest descent.&nbsp; The encoding is 
			shown
			<br>
			<IMG height=113 src="d8index.gif" width=120>, i.e. 1 - East, 2 - North 
			East, 3 - North, 4 - North West, 5 - West, 6 - South West, 7 - South, 8 - South 
			East.&nbsp;&nbsp; Slope is evaluated in the direction of steepest descent and 
			is reported as drop/distance, i.e. tan of the angle.&nbsp; Flow direction is 
			reported as "no data" for any grid cell adjacent to the edge of the DEM domain, 
			or adjacent to a no data value in the DEM.&nbsp; In flat areas flow directions 
			are assigned away from higher ground and towards lower ground using the method 
			of <A href="TauDEM.html#references" >Garbrecht and Martz (1997)</A>.&nbsp; The flow path 
			grid to enforce drainage along existing streams is an optional input, and if 
			input, takes precedence over elevations for the setting of flow 
			directions.&nbsp; The D8 flow direction algorithm may be applied to a DEM that 
			has not had pits filled, but will then result in no data values for flow 
			direction and slope associated with the lowest point of the pit.
			<h4>
				<hr WIDTH="100%">
				Dinf Flow Directions</h4>
			Input:
			<ul>
				<li>
				Pit Filled Elevation grid.
				<li>
					[Verified flow path grid (fdrn).]</li>
			</ul>
			Output:
			<ul>
				<li>
				Dinf flow direction grid (ang).
				<li>
					Dinf slope grid (slp).</li>
			</ul>
			<a NAME="dinffigure"></a>Method:&nbsp; The Dinf approach assigns a flow 
			direction based on steepest slope on a triangular facet (Tarboton, 1997).
			<table BORDER="2" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="2">
				<tr>
					<td>
						<center><IMG height=325 src="tardemfig.gif" width=416>
							<br>
							Flow direction defined as steepest downward slope on planar triangular facets 
							on a block centered grid.</center>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			Flow direction is encoded as an angle 'ang' in radians counter-clockwise from 
			east as a continuous (floating point) quantity between 0 and 2 pi. The flow 
			direction angle is determined as the direction of the steepest downward slope 
			on the eight triangular facets formed in a 3 x 3 grid cell window centered on 
			the grid cell of interest. A block-centered representation is used with each 
			elevation value taken to represent the elevation of the center of the 
			corresponding grid cell. Eight planar triangular facets are formed between each 
			grid cell and its eight neighbors. Each of these has a downslope vector which 
			when drawn outwards from the center may be at an angle that lies within or 
			outside the 45<sup>o</sup> (pi/4 radian) angle range of the facet at the center 
			point. If the slope vector angle is within the facet angle, it represents the 
			steepest flow direction on that facet. If the slope vector angle is outside a 
			facet, the steepest flow direction associated with that facet is taken along 
			the steepest edge. The slope and flow direction associated with the grid cell 
			is taken as the magnitude and direction of the steepest downslope vector from 
			all eight facets. Slope is measured as drop/distance, i.e. tan of the slope 
			angle.&nbsp; In the case where no slope vectors are positive (downslope), the 
			flow direction is set using the method of Garbrecht and Martz (1997) for the 
			determination of flow across flat areas. This makes flat areas drain away from 
			high ground and towards low ground. The flow path grid to enforce drainage 
			along existing streams is an optional input and is only used for the resolving 
			of flow directions across flat areas.
			<h4>
				<hr WIDTH="100%">
				D8 Contributing Area</h4>
			Input:
			<ul>
				<li>
				D8 Flow Direction grid (p).
				<li>
				[Outlets Shapefile.]
				<li>
					[Weights grid.]</li>
			</ul>
			Output:
			<ul>
				<li>
					D8 Contributing Area grid (ad8).</li>
			</ul>
		Method:&nbsp; Contributing area counted in terms of the number of grid cells 
		(or summation of weights) is calculated using a recursive procedure due to 
		(Mark, 1988). The contribution at each grid cell is taken as one (or from the 
		weight grid when the optional weight grid input is used).&nbsp; The 
		contributing area for each grid cell is taken as its own contribution plus the 
		contribution from upslope neighbors that drain in to it. This is evaluated 
		recursively starting from points (outlets) in the outlets shapefile, or when 
		this is not input at each point in the grid.&nbsp; Starting the recursive 
		evaluation at outlet points results in only the contributing area that drains 
		to the designated outlets being evaluated.
		<p>The contributing area programs check for edge contamination.&nbsp; This is 
			defined as the possibility that a contributing area value may be underestimated 
			due to grid cells outside of the domain not being counted.&nbsp; This occurs 
			when drainage is inwards from the boundaries or areas with no data values for 
			elevation.&nbsp; The algorithm recognizes this and reports no data for the 
			contributing area.&nbsp; It is common to see streaks of no data values 
			extending inwards from boundaries along flow paths that enter the domain at a 
			boundary.&nbsp; This is the desired effect and indicates that contributing area 
			for these grid cells is unknown due to it being dependent on terrain outside of 
			the domain of data available.&nbsp; Edge contamination checking may be 
			overridden in cases where you know this is not an issue or want to ignore these 
			problems, if for example the DEM has been clipped along a watershed outline.
			<h4>
				<hr WIDTH="100%">
				Dinf Contributing Area</h4>
			Input:
			<ul>
				<li>
				Dinf Flow Direction grid (ang).
				<li>
				[Outlets Shapefile.]
				<li>
					[Weights grid.]</li>
			</ul>
			Output:
			<ul>
				<li>
					D8 Contributing Area grid (ad8).</li>
			</ul>
			Method:&nbsp; Contributing area counted in terms of the number of grid cells 
			(or summation of weights)&nbsp; is calculated for the multiple flow direction 
			Dinf approach using a recursive procedure that is an extension of the very 
			efficient recursive algorithm for single directions (Mark, 1988). The 
			contribution at each grid cell is taken initially as one (or from the weight 
			grid when the optional weight grid input is used).&nbsp; The contributing area 
			of each grid cell is then taken as its own contribution plus the contribution 
			from upslope neighbors that have some fraction draining to it. The flow from 
			each cell either all drains to one neighbor, if the angle falls along a 
			cardinal (0, <font face="Symbol">p</font>/2, <font face="Symbol">p</font>, 3<font face="Symbol">p</font>/2) 
			or diagonal (<font face="Symbol">p</font>/4, 3<font face="Symbol">p</font>/4, 5<font face="Symbol">p</font>/4, 
			7<font face="Symbol">p</font>/4) direction, or is on an angle falling between 
			the direct angle to two adjacent neighbors. In the latter case the flow is 
			proportioned between these two neighbor pixels according to how close the flow 
			direction angle is to the direct angle to those pixels, as illustrated in the <A href="TauDEM.html#dinffigure" >
				Dinf flow direction figure above</A>
		.
		<p>
		Where no weight grid is used as input, the result is reported in terms of 
		specific catchment area, the upslope area per unit contour length, taken here 
		as the number of cells times grid cell size (cell area divided by cell size). 
		This assumes that grid cell size is the effective contour length, in the 
		definition of specific catchment area and does not distinguish any difference 
		in contour length dependent upon the flow direction. Where a weight grid is 
		used the result is reported directly as a summation of weights, without any 
		scaling.
		<p>
		Contributing area is evaluated recursively starting from points (outlets) in 
		the outlets shapefile, or when this is not input at each point in the 
		grid.&nbsp; Starting the recursive evaluation at outlet points results in only 
		the contributing area that drains to the designated outlets being evaluated.
		<p>The contributing area programs check for edge contamination.&nbsp; This is 
			defined as the possibility that a contributing area value may be underestimated 
			due to grid cells outside of the domain not being counted.&nbsp; This occurs 
			when drainage is inwards from the boundaries or areas with no data values for 
			elevation.&nbsp; The algorithm recognizes this and reports no data for the 
			contributing area.&nbsp; It is common to see streaks of no data values 
			extending inwards from boundaries along flow paths that enter the domain at a 
			boundary.&nbsp; This is the desired effect and indicates that contributing area 
			for these grid cells is unknown due to it being dependent on terrain outside of 
			the domain of data available.&nbsp; Edge contamination checking may be 
			overridden in cases where you know this is not an issue or want to ignore these 
			problems, if for example the DEM has been clipped along a watershed outline.

				<hr WIDTH="100%">
				Grid Network Order and Flow Path Lengths</h4>
			Input:
			<ul>
				<li>
				D8 Flow Direction grid (p).
				<li>
				[Raster grid and threshold value.]
				<li>
					[Outlets shapefile.]</li>
			</ul>
			Output:
			<ul>
				<li>
				Strahler Network order grid (gord)
				<li>
				Longest Upslope Length grid (plen).
				<li>
					Total Upslope Length grid (tlen).</li>
			</ul>
			Method:&nbsp; The D8 flow direction grid defines a grid network that extends to 
			each grid cell.&nbsp; This function orders this network according to the 
			Strahler ordering system.&nbsp; Cells that don't have any other grid cells 
			draining in to them are order 1.&nbsp; When two (or more) flow paths of 
			different order join the order of the downstream flow path is the order of the 
			highest incoming flow path.&nbsp; When two (or more) flow paths of equal order 
			join the downstream flow path is increased by 1.&nbsp; Algorithmically this is 
			implemented as:
			<br>
		Order = Max(Highest incoming flow path order, Second highest incoming flow path 
		order + 1).&nbsp; This generalizes the common definition to cases where more 
		than two flow paths join at a point.
		<p>
		The longest upslope length is the length of the flow path from the furthest 
		cell that drains to each cell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The total upslope path length 
		is the length of the entire grid network upslope of each grid cell.&nbsp; 
		Lengths are measured between cell centers taking into account cell size and 
		whether the direction is adjacent or diagonal.
		<p>Where the optional raster grid and threshold value are input, the function is 
			evaluated only considering grid cells that lie in the domain with raster grid 
			value greater than or equal to the threshold value.&nbsp; Source (first order) 
			grid cells are taken as those that do not have any other grid cells from inside 
			the domain draining in to them, and only when two of these flow paths join is 
			order propagated according to the ordering rules.&nbsp; Lengths are also only 
			evaluated counting paths within the domain greater than or equal to the 
			threshold.

				River Network Raster Function</h4>
			This function is invoked by both the "Full River Network Raster" menu item 
			under "Basic Grid Analysis" and "River Network Raster Upstream of Outlets" menu 
			item inder "Network Delineation"
			<br>
			Input:
			<ul>
				<li>
				Pit Filled Elevation grid (fel).
				<li>
				D8 Flow Direction grid (p).
				<li>
				D8 Contributing Area grid (ad8).
				<li>

				<li>
					Outlets Shapefile</li>
			</ul>
			Output:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Stream Raster Grid (src)</li>
			</ul>
			Methods:&nbsp; The output is a grid indicating streams, by the grid cell value 
			1 on streams and 0 off streams. Six stream delineation methods are provided 
			each with their own parameters that may be adjusted on the interface.&nbsp; 
			These methods are:
			<ul>
				<li>
				Use existing streams.&nbsp; To use this method existing streams need to have 
				been "burned in" by using an enforced flow path grid (fdr) with "Fill Pits" and 
				"D8 Flow Directions" functions. The stream network raster is then defined from 
				these flow directions.&nbsp; No parameters are required.
				<li>
				DEM curvature based.&nbsp; The DEM is first smoothed by a kernel with the 
				weights at the center, sides and diagonals as specified.&nbsp; The Peuker and 
				Douglas (1975) method (also explained in Band, 1986) is then used to identify 
				upwards curved grid cells.&nbsp; This method flags the entire grid, then 
				examines in a single pass each quadrant of 4 grid cells and unflags the 
				highest.&nbsp; The remaining flagged cells are deemed "upwards curved" and if 
				viewed resemble a channel network, although sometimes lacking connectivity, or 
				requiring thinning, issues that were discussed in detail by Band (1986).&nbsp; 
				The thinning and connecting of these grid cells is achieved here by computing 
				the contributing area using only these upwards curved cells.&nbsp; An 
				accumulation threshold on the number of these cells is used to map the channel 
				network.
				<li>
				Contributing area threshold.&nbsp;&nbsp; A threshold on the contributing area 
				(in number of cells) computed by the D8 (suffix ad8) method is used to 
				delineate streams.
				<li>
					Grid order threshold.&nbsp; A threshold on the network order grid (suffix gord) 
					is used to delineate streams.&nbsp; This is the network pruning by order 
					approach suggested by Peckham (1995) and used in <a href="http://www.rsinc.com/rivertools/index.cfm">
						RiverTools</a>.
				<li>
					Area and slope threshold.&nbsp; A threshold is applied to the product A S<sup>y</sup>
				with the threshold and exponent specified.&nbsp; A is the Dinf specific 
				catchment area (suffix sca) and S is the Dinf slope (suffix slp).&nbsp; This 
				method was suggested by Montgomery and Dietrich (1992).&nbsp; (They used the 
				exponent y = 2 and threshold C = 200 m in their study).
				<li>
					Area and length threshold.&nbsp; This is an experimental method that might be

			If drop analysis is checked, then the threshold is searched between the lowest 
			and highest values given, using the number of steps given on a log scale.&nbsp; 
			For the science behind the drop analysis see Tarboton et al. (1991, 1992), 
			Tarboton and Ames (2001).&nbsp; The smallest threshold in the set searched with 
			absolute value of the t statistic less than 2 is selected.&nbsp; This is done 
			automatically during the River Network Raster (Upstream of Outlets) step.&nbsp; 
			The threshold selected is saved in the threshold variable so may be inspected 
			afterwards by viewing the function interface following completion.&nbsp; Drop 
			analysis is only possible when outlets have been specified, because if an 
			entire grid domain is analyzed, as the threshold varies, shorter streams 
			draining off the edge may not meeth the threshold criterion and be excluded 
			from the analysis.&nbsp; This makes defining drainage density difficult and it 
			is somewhat inconsistent to compare statistics evaluated over differing 
			domains.

			Method:&nbsp; This function produces a vector network from the Stream Raster 
			grid by tracing down from each source grid cell.&nbsp; The network topological 
			connectivity is stored in the Stream Network Tree file, and coordinates and 
			attributes from each grid cell along the network in the Stream Network 
			Coordinates file.&nbsp; The Stream Raster grid is used as the source for the 
			stream network, with Flow Direction Grid used to facilitate tracing down the 
			flow paths.&nbsp; Elevations and Contributing Area are used to determine the 
			Coordinate elevation and contributing area attributes.&nbsp; Points in the 
			Outlets Shapefile are used to logically split stream reaches to facilitate 
			representing watersheds upstream and downstream of monitoring points.&nbsp; The 
			program has an option to trace downslope from outlet points until the stream 
			reach network is first encountered to accommodate situations where gage 
			locations are not accurately registered with respect to the stream 
			network.&nbsp; The program looks for an attribute field "id" in the Outlets 
			Shapefile and if found uses the numbers therein as identifiers in the Tree

			Method:&nbsp; This function translates the text file vector network

			Method:&nbsp; This function translates the grid watershed representation into a

			<br>
			The columns are:
			<ul>

				The drainage density (inverse length units - typically m) of the resulting 
				network.
				<li>
				Number of first order streams (Strahler ordering) in network with specified

				<li>
				Number of higher order streams (Sequential segments of the same order are 
				counted as one Strahler stream) in network with specified threshold.
				<li>
				Mean drop (elevation difference between start and end) of first order streams.
				<li>
				Mean drop of higher order streams.
				<li>

			The procedure suggested in Tarboton et al. (1991, 1992) and Tarboton and Ames 
			(2001) is to select the smallest threshold for which the absolute value of the 
			t statistic is less than 2.&nbsp; This selects the highest resolution network 
			consistent with the "constant drop law".&nbsp; In the display above the 
			threshold of 14 would be selected.&nbsp; It is worthwhile to view the drop 
			analysis because the threshold steps are sometimes quite coarse, so the user 
			may want to use the River Network Raster function to change the number of 
			intervals and lowest and highest values used in the search.&nbsp; Also it can 
			occur that a large threshold is "correct" but a small threshold results in 
			second or higher order streams also extending into the region that should not 
			be streams.&nbsp; If these dominate the sample the following sequence of t 
			statistics might result:
			<br>
			&lt;2, &lt;2, &lt;2, &gt;2, &gt;2, &lt;2, &lt;2, ...
			<br>
			The automatic procedure in these cases would pick the lowest threshold, but it 
			is probably better (and this is admittedly subjective, unfortunately) to pick 
			the 6th threshold.&nbsp; In making this judgement I feel that it is best to 
			consider many things, like sample sizes (is the t statistic robust), the visual 
			impression in comparison to contour crenulations, and the drainage density that 
			would result from a Slope versus Area plot as discussed in Tarboton et al., 
			(1991, 1992).&nbsp; The automated procedure is therefore not foolproof and some 
			degree of judgement and subjectivity is required.

			</ul>
			Method:&nbsp; This function takes the ratio Slope/(Specific Catchment

			</ul>
			Method:&nbsp; The Downslope Influence function (or influence zone) of a set y 
			within the domain is
			<br>
			I(x;y) = A[i(x;y)]
			<br> 
			where A[] is the weighted accumulation operator evaluated using the Dinf

			(1,0) function on the set y and I is evaluated using the weighted contributing 
			area function only on points in the set y.&nbsp; The disturbance grid is used 
			to encode the indicator function and must be 1 inside the zone y and 0 over the 
			rest of the domain.

			</ul>
			Method:&nbsp; A decayed accumulation operator DA[.] takes as input a mass 
			loading field m(x) expressed at each grid location as m(i, j) that is assumed 
			to move with the flow field but is subject to first order decay in moving from 
			cell to cell.&nbsp; The output is the accumulated mass at each location

			<IMG height=89 src="decayeqn.gif" width=776>
			<br>
			Here d(x) = d(i ,j) is a decay multiplier giving the fractional (first order)

			</ul>
			Method:&nbsp; This function applies to the situation where there is a supply of 
			substance (e.g. erosion) and capacity for transport of the substance (e.g. 
			sediment transport capacity).&nbsp;&nbsp; This function accumulates the 
			substance flux subject to the rule that the transport out of any grid cell is 
			the minimum of the transport in to that grid cell and the transport 
			capacity.&nbsp; There is then deposition in the amount of the difference.
			<br>
			<IMG height=119 src="tlaeqn.gif" width=323>
			<br>
			Here E is the supply (sup) and T<sub>cap</sub> the transport capacity 
			(tc).&nbsp; T<sub>out</sub> at each grid cell becomes T<sub>in </sub>for 
			downslope grid cells and is reported as Transport limited accumulation 
			(tla).&nbsp; D is deposition (tdep).&nbsp; The function provides the option to

			</ul>
			Output:
			<ul>
				<li>
				Reverse Accumulation grid (racc).
				<li>
					Maximum Downslope grid (dmax).</li>
			</ul>
			Method:&nbsp; This works in a similar way to evaluation of weighted 
			Contributing area, except that the accumulation is by propagating the weight 
			loadings upslope along the reverse of the flow directions to accumulate the 
			quantity of weight loading downslope from each grid cell.&nbsp; The function 
			accumulates loading from the weight grid in excess of a weight threshold.&nbsp; 
			The function also reports the maximum value of the weight loading downslope 
			from each grid cell in the Maximum Downslope grid.
			<br>
			<IMG height=522 src="raccfig.gif" width=839>
			<br>
			This function is designed to evaluate and map the hazard due to activities that 
			may have an effect downslope.&nbsp; The example is land management activities 
			that increase runoff.&nbsp; Runoff is sometimes a trigger for landslides or 
			debris flows, so the weight grid here could be taken as a terrain stability 
			map.&nbsp; Then the reverse accumulation provides a measure of the amount of 
			unstable terrain downslope from each grid cell, as an indicator of the danger 
			of activities that may increase runoff, even though there may be no potential 
			for any local impact.

		<h4>
			Grid file formats</h4>
		The programs are written to access following grid file formats.
		<ul>
			<li>
			ESRI proprietary grid format.&nbsp; The file is a "folder" on the computer 
			comprising multiple parts.
			<li>
			ASCII format.&nbsp; A file with extension .asc.
			<li>
				Binary grid format.&nbsp; A file with extension .bgd.</li>
		</ul>
		The ASCII grid format is that used by ESRI for export of files from ArcView and 
		Arc/Info and comprises lines of header data followed by lists of cell values. 
		The header data includes the following keywords and values:
		<ul>
			<li>
			ncols - number of columns in the data set.
			<li>
			nrows - number of rows in the data set.
			<li>
			xllcenter or xllcorner - x-coordinate of the center or lower-left corner of the 
			lower-left cell.
			<li>
			yllcenter or yllcorner - y-coordinate of the center or lower-left corner of the 
			lower-left cell.
			<li>
			cellsize - cell size for the data set.
			<li>
				nodata_value - value in the file assigned to cells whose value is unknown. This 
				keyword and value is optional. The nodata_value defaults to -9999.</li>
		</ul>
		For example an ASCII grid file looks like,
		<pre>ncols 480
nrows 450
xllcorner 378923
yllcorner 4072345
cellsize 30
nodata_value -32768
43 3 45 7 3 56 2 5 23 65 34 6 32 etc
35 45 65 34 2 6 78 4 38 44 89 3 2 7 etcetc</pre>
		The first row of data is at the top of the data set, moving from left to right. 
		Cell values should be delimited by spaces. No carriage returns are necessary at 
		the end of each row in the data set. The number of columns in the header is 
		used to determine when a new row begins. The number of cell values must be 
		equal to the number of rows times the number of columns.
		<p>The ESRI and binary grid file formats are not defined here.&nbsp; They are only 
			accessed through the grid object that is part of the software.&nbsp; This uses 
			the gridio application programmers interface to access ESRI binary grids, and 
			provides a standard interface for accessing all the grids.
			<h4>
				Grid defintions and naming conventions</h4>
		To manage the variety of grid data used by TauDEM, a naming convention relying 
		on suffixes appended to the body of file names has been developed to identify 
		the contents of the files used.&nbsp; This convention is not required, but 
		makes things a lot easier and is used to set up default file names.&nbsp; Each 
		type of file is associated with a 1-4 character suffix that is appended to the 
		main part of the file name, before the extension used by the computer 
		system.&nbsp; If the Base Elevation grid name is "nnnn[.asc]" then the 
		remaining file names will be "nnnnsss[.asc]" where sss is the suffix.&nbsp; The 
		table below gives DEM grids used by TauDEM with these suffixes, and also 
		indicates the functions in which the grids are used, as input or output.&nbsp; 
		If the file is an ESRI grid, then there will be no extension (no part in []) 
		because ESRI grids are folders.&nbsp; To access ESRI grids in a file open 
		dialog in MapWindow TauDEM it is necessary to open the sta.adf file inside the 
		ESRI grid folder.&nbsp; However do not be tempted to move these files or 
		folders around using Windows Explorer, because all the files in the folder, as 
		well as some in an info folder comprise the grid dataset.&nbsp; There are 
		utilities for moving these files as part of ArcGIS.

				<a NAME="history"></a>History and command line versions</h4>
<P>This is version 3.0, released&nbsp; August 2004.&nbsp; This is a restructuring 
of the grid data access functionality to avoid dependence on the MapWindow 
tkgrid utility that had problems reading the Windows registry.&nbsp; Some other 
bug fixes have been included and this version has been compiled to work with 
ArcGIS 9.0.&nbsp; A MapWindow version of this release is not yet available due 
to MapWindow 3.0 now requiring that plugins be written in VB.net.&nbsp; The 
TauDEM interface is in VB6.0 and we have not had time to convert it.</P>
<P><A 
href="http://www.engineering.usu.edu/dtarb/taudem2.0/taudem.html" >Link to Version 2.0 
released September 2002</A>      .&nbsp; This&nbsp;was a 
restructuring of the packaging of TauDEM.&nbsp; Instead of a standalone 
executable that had MapWindow inserted as a control, TauDEM has now been made 
into a Plugin, that can work with both MapWindow and ArcGIS.&nbsp; Substantial 
additional functionality has been added and quite a few bugs removed. </P>
