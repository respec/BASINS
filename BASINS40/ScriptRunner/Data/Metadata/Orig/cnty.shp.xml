<abstract>This coverage is of the county boundaries of the conterminous United
States.  It was derived from the U.S. Geological Survey State Boundaries,
which were derived from Digital Line Graph (DLG) files representing the
1:2,000,000-scale map in the National Atlas of the United States.</abstract>
<purpose>This coverage is intended as a basemap for a variety of applications.</purpose>
<supplinf>Limitations_of_Data:
The original files for this map were provided in 15 sections.
Boundaries near the edges of sections have been adjusted in
edgematching.

Procedures:
The BASINS data product was derived from the U.S. Geological Survey
COUNTIES2M layer.  The USGS procedures for that data product are followed
by the BASINS procedures:

This series of maps was published as part of the National Atlas of
the United States (USGS, 1970).  The maps for the conterminous
United States were digitized in 15 sheets and published in the
Digital Line Graph (DLG) format as described by Domeratz and others
(1983).

Each sheet was prepared by reading the DLG files of the political
and water bodies layers, converting them to ARC/INFO, extracting
the county boundaries and the coastline, respectively, and joining
the two layers together.  FIPS codes were assigned to all polygons
using available sources, and were checked manually.

Boundaries with adjacent sheets of the 15-sheet set were
edgematched manually, arbitrarily choosing one of the sheets as the
"correct" border.  Edgematching operations adjusted the linework as
far as was necessary so that the coverages would fit to a tolerance
of 100 meters.  The coverage (referred to herein as Version 1.0)
was stored as 49 separate coverages (48 states and the District of
Columbia) because the ARC/INFO software in use at the time could
not process the entire coverage.  Individual states could be joined
by specifying a tolerance of 100 meters.

From time to time, adjustments were made to the state coverages to
reflect changes in U.S. counties.  It is believed the accuracy of
these adjustments is comparable to the original linework.

For Version 2.0, all state coverages were rejoined and manually
edited to produce a perfect edgematch between all states.  For
states on the original map sheet boundaries, this adjustment
averaged less than 20 meters and in no case was more than 100
meters.  The whole coverage was CLEANed to a tolerance of 20
meters, which resulted in few, if any, effects on small offshore
islands. The coverage also was checked to ensure that it
represented current U.S. counties or county equivalents.

The coverage in Version 1.0 stopped at the coastline.  There was no
attempt to depict offshore areas.  The created some problems when
the coverage was used to assign county codes to sampling stations
located near the coast.  To help in this matter, Version 2.o
includes offshore extensions of the county polygons.  The (water)
boundaries of many of these polygons are arbitrary.

The Canadian Great Lakes features are another new addition to
Version 2.0.  They were added to improve the utility of the
coverage for visual displays.  Although the Canadian Great Lakes
are logically represented by a single polygon, practical
considerations -- the inability of some software to plot polygons
with a large number of vertices -- made it necessary to separate
them into 4 polygons.  The dividing lines are located in narrow
channels to minimize interference with plotting patterns.  Canadian
islands within the Great Lakes also were included.

All tics were relocated to places that are easily visible on maps
of the United States, to help in registering maps that may not
otherwise have adequate registration information.

To expedite accessing parts of the coverage, certain items have
been indexed with the procedure, index_county.aml.  See Section 3
above.  A spatial index also was created.

When using this coverage to clip or intersect other coverages, a
tolerance as low as 2 meters can be used.

The processing used to derive this coverage moved boundaries from
their positions on the original maps.  In cases of conflicting
lines, preference was given to forming the correct topology.
Strictly speaking, this coverage is not identical to the source
materials.  These changes were unavoidable in producing a
continuous coverage of the conterminous United States.

For revision 2.1, it was necessary to alter about 100 arcs.  This
was accomplished with ARCEDIT using the 1:100,000 TIGER county
coverage as a background.  These arcs were matched to the background
so that they matched at least as close as other arcs that were not
edited.

For distribution with BASINS v1.0, the national coverage was split into
a series of coverages that included the spatial extent of each of the nine
US EPA regions, plus the hydrologic accounting units that crossed Region
boundaries.  The nine regional coverages therefore overlapped at
Regional boundaries.  The coverages were distributed in PC ARC/INFO
coverage format.

For distribution with Basins v2.0, the PA ARC/INFO coverages were exported
on a PC then imported in  workstation ARC/INFO v7.0.4.  Each Regional coverage
was then projected to geographic decimal degrees, NAD83.  The coverages
were then converted to ESRI Shapefile format, using the ARCSHAPE command.

Reviews_Applied:
This coverage has received no formal review.  It has, however, been
used in numerous applications where serious errors would have been
obvious.  Some county coverages were corrected following such use.
The offshore polygon extensions and the Canadian Great Lakes
polygons have had no review.

BASINS v2.0 reviews: projected coverages were checked for topology. The
shapefile format features and attributes were visually inspected and
compared with the BASINS v1.0 PC ARC/INFO coverages.

Other_Related_Data_Sets:
This coverage was derived from USGS 1:2,000,000-scale basemaps
covering the United States.
