HSPEXP+1.11
Features
1. The timeseries can be transformed before plotting graphs when AutomatedGraphs option is selected. In the thirteenth column of timeseries description add the following text in quotes (without quotes) for the transformations.
	a. "c to f" --> Transform from celsius to Fahrenheit.
	b. "f to c" --> Transform from Fahrenheit to celsius.
	c. "sum c" --> Add the constant c to the timeseries.
	d. "product c" -->Multiply the constant c to the timeseries.
(This functionality will be listed in the Help Manual with next major upgrade.)
	
Bugs Fixed
1. The steptype was not plotted properly. Now the timeseries can be plotted as forwardstep, rearwardstep, or nonostep.
2. Some point symbols were not filled. Now all the point symbols are filled by default.

HSPEXP+1.1

Features
1. Nutrient Load Allocation Reports (new report) - MPCA supported the development of load allocation reports for sediment, Total Nitrogen(TN), and Total Phosphorus(TP) in HSPEXP+. The load allocation reports provide load and percent of total load, attributed to each upstream sources at all the reach end points in the watershed, and at the user-selected reaches, whenever sediment, TN, or TP reports are requested. The description of this process is provided in the updated User's Manual. 
2. Additional cases were added to calculate TN and TP input to a reach if particulate ammonia and orthophosphate are added to the reach as attached to sediment.

Bugs Fixed
1. A bug was fixed where HSPEXP+ would attempt to run HSPF12.3 instead of HSPF12.4(beta), if the user has HSPF12.3 installed.  HSPEXP+ now runs only HSPF12.4(beta) that is installed with HSPEXP+.
2. A bug was fixed where total water input to a reach was double counted in the Reach Budget Report for water.

HSPEXP+1.02
Features
1. HSPF12.4(beta) is available with this new version.

Bugs fixed
1. A bug was fixed which was causing subsequent runs of HSPEXP+ to crash, if "Run HSPF" option was selected.

HSPEXP+ now checks if the last run of the model was successful. If not, HSPEXP+ quits and recommends the user to correct the error before running the model.

AQUA TERRA Consultants releases an update to HSPEXP+1.0. This update addresses multiple issues and adds some small features.

Features
1. Based on the request from some users, HSPEXP+ loads with the link to previous project. This reduces the time spent in browsing the previous project.
2. HSPEXP+ does not close after producing the reports. A user can make changes to the project files and run HSPEXP+ again. This saves time as a typical user has to run HSPEXP+ multiple times to complete calibration, and the user does not have to restart HSPEXP+ every time.

Bugs fixed
1. The annual budget reports per reach was not reporting correct rates of nutrient loading if there were some PERLND or IMPLND with zero areas.  This bug has been fixed.
2. HSPEXP+ could not read the lines in EXS file with less characters than expected, and was crashing. This bug has been fixed.
3. HSPEXP+ was expecting Julian dates in AutomatedGraphs.csv. Now it expects dates in mm/dd/yyyy format.
4. Graphs are plotted even if no size for lines and symbols are provided. A default size 1 is assumed.
5. The legend font for frequency graphs was too big and has been reduced to size 12 font.
