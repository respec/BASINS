HSPEXP+3.0beta is the development version for the next version of HSPEXP+.
Features:
1. This version includes Model QA/QC report. The model QA/QC report is under development and it must be used with extreme caution.

Bugs Fixed:
1. The expert statistic calculated the years of simulation as an integer. This skewed calculations for models with very small model span. That has been fixed.
2. The location of help file was not coded properly in the previous version. That has been fixed.
3. The reports did not include adsorption/desorption and scour/deposition of TAM and PO4. That has been fixed.
4. The reports did not output labile and refractory organic P data for impervious areas. That has been fixed.

HSPEXP+2.0 is a major upgrade to HSPEXP+1.32. The following list of features added and bugs fixed for the version 2.0 includes all added features and fixed bugs in the earlier beta versions. The installer is now signed and it tells the users that the installer has been produced by RESPEC. This will reduce the security warnings.

Features:
1. Multi-Simulation Manager capability was added that can be used to conduct sensitivity analysis, uncertainty analysis, and scenario analysis.
2. Regan plots were updated to generate daily max and min DO for all the reaches, if hourly DO data is available in WDM or binary files.
3. The HSPEXP+ Manual is now available as a pdf file for ease of printing.
4. Reports for additional constituents including Heat, DO, BOD-Labile are also generated.
5. Reach Budget reports for N and P constituents are also generated.
6. Some reports are now generated so that they can be easily filtered in spreadsheet program.
7. Monthly land loading reports are also generated.
8. Box-whisker plots of constituent loading by land use and box-whisker plots of monthly constituent loadings are also produced.
9. If GQUAL is simulated, then land loading and reach budget reports for all the GQUAL constituents are available.
10. If the observed data in WQX format has been filtered using BASINS, that file can be read by HSPEXP+ to generated automated graphs.

Bugs fixed:
1. If observed flow data is of shorter length than the simulated data then expert statistics and annual graphs were not working properly. That issue has been fixed.
2. If MASS-LINK block did not have proper connection for constituents, then HSPEXP+ gave error and quit. Now a more useful error is presented.
3. While making automated graphs, warnings have been moved to the log file.
4. In some cases, if the GENER operation didn't exist, HSPEXP+ crashed. Fixed.
5. Some reports were having issues with analysis date. Fixed.
6. If input PS and model timestep were hourly, point sources were not being calculated. Fixed
7. Multiple small bugs fixed. In general, the warning messages do not stop HSPEXP+ calculations. The warning messages are added in the log file.

HSPEXP+1.32
Features:
1. A user can now add, subtract, multiply, or divide a timeseries to an existing time series before plotting. Keywords "add", "subtract", "multiply", or "divide" will ensure that the timeseries in the current row will get added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided to the timeseries in the previous row.

Bugs Fixed:
1. Error checking has been improved. If HSPEXP+ cannot find a timeseries, it provides a proper error message and moves to the next graph, and generates rest of the graphs.
2. Code has been cleaned by removing unneeded variables and references.

Dated: 4/14/2017
HSPEXP+1.31
Bugs Fixed
1. The surface runoff, potential evapotranspiration, interflow were not being reported in the ExpertStats output report. This issue has been fixed.

Dated: 3/30/2017
HSPEXP+1.30
1. Expert Statistics with non-continuous data - If the observed flow data is non-continuous, HSPEXP+ compares the observed and simulated data and discards the data for dates where corresponding observed data is not available. The expert statistics calculation, annual, monthly, and daily flow comparisons are conducted on the remaining data. All output reports include information about the percent of data that is missing, and to use caution while using the results
2. Graphs from JSON Files - BASINS 4.5 and later versions will have the capability to produce graph specifications as a JSON file. HSPEXP+1.30 can produce graphs using the JSON file if it is available in the project folder.
3. Regan Plots - Regan Plots were expanded with following two plots.
	3a. When River Eutrophication Standard (RES) file is provided in the project file as a *.csv file with names as RES_TP_Standard.csv, total phosphorus load duration curves are generated at the locations where RES standard is provided. The RES Standard file expects Reach Number and Reach standard separated by a comma.
	3b. If model output binary files contain sediment output, TSS plots at all the locations are produced along with the bed depth. These plots help determine if there is any issue with the model stability.
4. Box-Whisker Plot of nutrient loadings - When nutrient loading reports are generated, HSPEXP+ also generates a box-whisker plot of nutrient loading rates of ech land use. This helps a modeler quickly compare the land use loading rates and notice any anomalies.
5. Bar graph of the nutrient loading allocation - When a user requests nutrient reports at specific locations, a bar graph of nutrient loads at those locations is also generated.
6. GENER Sources from the NETWORK Block - The reach budget and load allocation reports now include the GENER sources that are listed in NETWORK block.

Bugs Fixed:

1. The nutrient loading rate reports had some calculation mistake, which could be noticed only in big models. It has been fixed.
2. The reach budget calculations and loading rate calculations have been improved.
3. Default values for line and point size have been added in the graphing section.
4. If HSPEXP+ is started and the UCI file is not read properly, HSPEXP+ gives an option to browse to a different UCI file.


Dated 11/22/2016
HSPEXP+ 1.21
Bugs Fixed:
1. HSPEXP+ was giving error when some PERLND or IMPLND did not have any area draining to RCHRES. This bug has been fixed.


Dated 11/14/2016
HSPEXP+1.20
Features:
1. The HSPEXP+ form now allows users to select analysis dates, in case a user wants to select a different analysis period than the model run.
2. The HSPEXP+ form performs improved validation for checking the validity of the UCI file before enabling the controls.
3. The budget reports now check whether GENER sources are included to provide input to the RCHRES in the SCHEMATIC block, and then calculate the loadings from the GENER operations. The GENER operation must output a timeseries to a WDM file in order to be included in the report.
4. "Regan Plots" - which are concurrent plots of nutrient concentrations and algal forms can be generated for all reaches automatically if PLANK section is active and all the outputs are written to the binary file at a monthly or shorter interval.
5. Tool tips are available on the HSPEXP+ form, to better guide users while running HSPEXP+.
6. An additional loading rate summary table is generated that shows loading rates of sediment, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus by the land use and operations, and also lists average, minimum, and maximum loading rates.
7. BOD-Reports are now referred to as BOD-Labile report to clarify that the BOD loadings from land area include the mass-link factor fractions.
8. HSPEXP+ help manual has been updated.
 
Bugs Fixed:
1. The load allocation reports have been improved for calculation of percent contribution of different sources.
2. The point sources calculations have been improved to include cases when the input load can be attached to sediments or be available as a biological material.
3. The model gives a useful warning if no echo file is available, instead of crashing.
4. Previously, the balance reports at specific locations were not outputting the correct loads. Those reports have been fixed.
5. Graph generation code has been fixed where the graph generation had issues with the auxiliary axis.

Dated 05/20/2016
HSPEXP+1.13
Features
1. The CSV file is read using a CSV parser which means that the field in quotes are read as one field and the comma inside
quotes is ignored.
2. If a PERLND or IMPLND does not have a valid downstream connection, then that connection is skipped while calculating the
contituent balance reports.
3. If QUALID doesn't meet HSPEXP+ criteria, HSPEXP+ gives warning and quits.
4. Water quality and water balance report generation process is more efficient so that bigger HBN files can be used for
generating reports.

Dated 03/11/2016
HSPEXP+1.12
Features
1. PBIAS has been added as a statistic for time series comparison.
2. RSR (RMSE-Observations standard deviation ratio) has been added as a statistic for time series comparison.
3. Appropriate references have been provided for the two statistics above.
4. Caution has been added to annual flow statistics to avoid misinterpretation of results.

Bugs Fixed

1. Table 1 in the SWSTAT output (classwise comparison of errors, root mean square errors and bias) has been removed due to
confusion in the bias calculation procedures.



Dated 12/02/2015
HSPEXP+1.11
Features
1. New splash screen and updated user's manual.
2. Any timeseries can be transformed before plotting graphs when Graph Generation option is selected. In the thirteenth
column of timeseries description, add the following text inside the quotes (without quotes) for the transformations.

            a. "c to f" --> Transform from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
            b. "f to c" --> Transform from Fahrenheit to Celsius.
            c. "sum c" --> Add the constant c to the timeseries.
            d. "product c" -->Multiply the timeseries by the constant c.

3. A timeseries can be aggregated to extract percentiles. For example, a user can specify to extract 75% percentile of daily
values from an hourly timeseries by specifying "Daily" as the "Aggregation" and "%75" as the "Aggregation Type."
4. The specifications for graphs can be in multiple *.csv files, and the names are no longer hardcoded. HSPEXP+ looks for all
the *.csv files in the project folder for making graphs. HSPEXP+ typically ignores the *csv files that do not have data
properly formatted for additional graphs. However, it is user's responsibility to make sure that all the *.csv files in the
project folder are properly formatted.         

Bugs Fixed

1. The steptype was not plotted properly. Now the timeseries can be plotted as forwardstep, rearwardstep, or nonstep.
2. Some point symbols were not filled in graphs. Now all the point symbols are filled by default. 
3. When HSPEXP+ is started, the pConstituents collection is cleared so that the reports of any constituents from the previous
run are not generated.
4. In hydrology calibration, log scale and supplemental graphs are plotted only if hydrology calibration graphs are selected.
5. Graphs are generated even if the two header lines starting with "Type of Graph", and "Axis for the Curve" do not exist or
are commented out using "***" in the graph specification file(s).
6. The code for reading the HSPF echo file was improved to read echo files with larger size.
7. The load allocation reports were calculating incorrect loadings when the model contained reach numbers with less than 3
digits. This bug has been fixed.
8. The point source contribution calculation for Total N didn't include nitrite when it was available as a separate source.
This bug has been fixed.
9. More error checking has been added in the code for graph generation.

HSPEXP+1.1

Features
1. Nutrient Load Allocation Reports (new report) - MPCA supported the development of load allocation reports for sediment,
Total Nitrogen(TN), and Total Phosphorus(TP) in HSPEXP+. The load allocation reports provide load and percent of total load,
attributed to each upstream sources at all the reach end points in the watershed, and at the user-selected reaches, whenever
sediment, TN, or TP reports are requested. The description of this process is provided in the updated User's Manual. 
2. Additional cases were added to calculate TN and TP input to a reach if particulate ammonia and orthophosphate are added to
the reach as attached to sediment.

Bugs Fixed
1. A bug was fixed where HSPEXP+ would attempt to run HSPF12.3 instead of HSPF12.4(beta), if the user has HSPF12.3 installed. 
HSPEXP+ now runs only HSPF12.4(beta) that is installed with HSPEXP+.
2. A bug was fixed where total water input to a reach was double counted in the Reach Budget Report for water.



Dated: 07/02/2015
HSPEXP+1.02
Features
1. HSPF12.4(beta) is available with this new version.

Bugs fixed
1. A bug was fixed which was causing subsequent runs of HSPEXP+ to crash, if "Run HSPF" option was selected.



Dated: 05/13/2015
HSPEXP+ now checks if the last run of the model was successful. If not, HSPEXP+ quits and recommends the user to correct the
error before running the model.
Dated: 05/11/2015
AQUA TERRA Consultants releases an update to HSPEXP+1.0. This update addresses multiple issues and adds some small features.

Features
1. Based on the request from some users, HSPEXP+ loads with the link to previous project. This reduces the time spent in
browsing the previous project.
2. HSPEXP+ does not close after producing the reports. A user can make changes to the project files and run HSPEXP+ again.
This saves time as a typical user has to run HSPEXP+ multiple times to complete calibration, and the user does not have to
restart HSPEXP+ every time.

Bugs fixed
1. The annual budget reports per reach was not reporting correct rates of nutrient loading if there were some PERLND or
IMPLND with zero areas.  This bug has been fixed.
2. HSPEXP+ could not read the lines in EXS file with less characters than expected, and was crashing. This bug has been
fixed.
3. HSPEXP+ was expecting Julian dates in AutomatedGraphs.csv. Now it expects dates in mm/dd/yyyy format.
4. Graphs are plotted even if no size for lines and symbols are provided. A default size 1 is assumed.
5. The legend font for frequency graphs was too big and has been reduced to size 12 font.
