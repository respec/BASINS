<P>General Description </P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AESOP the Advanced Ecological System Modeling Program is an enhanced version of the WASP family of models. AESOP is used to evaluate receiving water quality issues.  AESOP solves general mass balance equations for water quality variables of interest.  The user is able, via the development of a FORTRAN subroutine, to tailor AESOP to address the specific water quality variables of the water body under investigation.  The FORTRAN subroutine prescribes the biological, chemical and/or physical kinetics or interrelationships between the relevant water quality variables of interest. Therefore, the user may run models from a simple conservative tracer, or first-order decay pathogen model to a more advances eutrophication model coupled to a sediment nutrient flux model and a chemical equilibrium model.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AESOP formulates mass balance equations for each model segment for each water quality constituent or state-variable of interest.  These mass balance equations include all horizontal, lateral and vertical components and biological transformations between the water quality variables within a model segment, and forcing functions of the various water quality variables of interest.</P>

<U><P>Model methods include the following:</P>
</U>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AESOP is a finite difference model which can be used for 1-D, 2-D and 3-D applications. The model requires that each segment be numbered by the user, and as part of the input the user indicates which segments are in contact to a particular grid cell.  The user may decide whether to use a explicit or implicit integration scheme.  The explicit scheme uses the Euler integration method, while the implicit algorithm uses a Gauss-Seidel integration method.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">AESOP requires input including exchange coefficients, segment volumes, flows, boundary conditions, forcing functions, parameters, constants, time functions, initial conditions, stability and accuracy criteria, integration information and output controls.  Exchange coefficients and flows can be input in one of two ways: </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">1) user-specified; which involves calibration to a conservative tracer such as salinity, dye or temperature, or</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">2) from a separate or off-line hydrodynamic model.  The latter assumes that the hydrodynamic information is written in the appropriate file format required by AESOP.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">User defined exchange coefficients, flows, boundary conditions, forcing functions and time functions can be assigned as step functions or piecewise linear functions.  Scale factors are available to facilitate the conversion of the user<FONT FACE="WP TypographicSymbols">=</FONT>s time and space units to those consistent with AESOP.  Scale factors can also be used to scale input data in sensitivity analyses. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<U><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Limitations</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The user must be familiar with FORTRAN and have the source code to modify the systems available in the model.  The model does not have a graphical user interface for creating model input or viewing model output.  </P>

<U><P>Application History</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since its development in 1980, AESOP has been used for numerous applications including the New York Bight, Long Island Sound, Lake Champlain, Lake Erie, tributaries in Jamaica Bay, the Potomac River and others.  Applications have included simple coliform models, BOD/DO models and advanced eutrophication.</P>
