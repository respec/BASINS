Wizard scripts use polish notation (Operator Argument Argument ...)
The best way to learn how they work is to examine the sample
scripts (*.ws) but this reference may also be helpful.

              This fills in any omitted, missing, or accumulated
              values to create a constant interval dataset
              First arg is first letter of time units:
                    Century, Year, Month, Hour, minute, second
              Next arg is number of time units between values
                    (default 1)
              Next arg is value to fill in for omitted values
                    (default 0)
              Next arg is value to fill in between missing values.
                    Missing values are those set to -999 by the script
                    (default -999)

Not           (While (Not EOF) ...
              Returns logical opposite of its argument (0, 1)

Or            (If (Or EOF (> Repeat 31)) ...

Set           (Set Constituent Col2)
              Assigns value of second argument to variable named
              by first argument. 
 
Test          (Test (And (< Year 2100) (> Year 1800)))
              If the last expression within a Test returns True
              (True = 1) then this script will be highlighted.

Trim          (Set Constituent (Trim Col2))
              Evaluates to its argument without surrounding spaces

Unset         (Unset Constituent)
              Opposite of Set. Remove variable definition.

Value         (Value Value)
              The example is confusing - We should change one of
              these uses of the word. The second Value is the name
              of the column from the column definition.
              Assigns argument to data value in current dataset at
              current date 

Warn          (Warn "Uh, oh!")
              A message box is opened, then the script proceeds.

While         (While (Not EOF) ... )
              The first argument is evaluated for truth (0 or 1).
              If true, the other arguments are evaluated (run)
              and then the loop repeats.

>             (If (> Repeats 31) ... )
>=            Comparison operators evaluate to 1 if the comparison
<             is true, 0 if it is false.

Fixed width ColumnFormat Example and discussion

  (ColumnFormat Fixed
                61-66:Value
                32-35:Year
                36-37:Month
                59-60:Hour
                9-31:Location
                55-58:Constituent
                1-8:Station
                38-42:Latitude
                43-48:Longitude
                49-54:Elevation
                59-66:Repeating)

For fixed width columns, the first argument is "Fixed". 
All other arguments are in the format columns:name. 
Columns are numbered starting with 1 for the first character.
Columns is either a single number indicating a single character
position (perhaps a flag column) or a pair of numbers indicating a
range of columns. 
10-12 indicates a columns that includes three characters on each
line: 10, 11, and 12. 
10+3 indicates the same three characters and is merely an
alternate syntax for convenience.

The name which appears after the colon is how this column is
referred to later in the script. 

Repeating is a special column name. This is specified if there is
more than one value on a line. The columns specified for Repeating
are the first set of character positions that show the pattern. In
the example above, 59-66:Repeating includes the colums for
59-60:Hour and 61-66:Value so both of these columns repeat. It is
important to get the boundaries of Repeating correct - The
character just after the end of Repeating should correspond to the
first character of Repeating. For example, if 50-59:repeating is
specified, that range should include the first value on the line
and 60-69 should contain the second value and so on. When reading
all the values on a line, the special variable Repeat is used to
determine which position we are looking at.

For delimited columns, the first argument would be "Tab" or
"Space" or a string of characters which are each to be treated as
a delimiter. For an Excel spreadsheet saved as comma-separated
values where one column is a date in the format 6/12/99, the first
argument might be ,/ so the parts of the date will be separated
as well as the other columns. As of May 9, 2000 the code for
reading delimited files is not yet complete, so the discussion
will focus on fixed-width columns.
