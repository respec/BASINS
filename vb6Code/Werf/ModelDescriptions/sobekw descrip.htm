<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">General Description</U>:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SOBEK has three basic product lines covering any fresh water management situation in river, rural, and urban systems alike. Each product line consists of different modules to simulate particular aspects of the water system. These modules can be operated separately or in combination. The data transfer between the modules is fully automatic and modules can be run in sequence or simultaneously to facilitate the physical interaction. Only the river and rural modules have water quality components.<BR>
</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All product lines use the same interface components. The interfaces of the urban and rural product lines are fully integrated. The user interface is used to prepare a model grid,  input data, check for possible schematization errors, and helps to analyze both input data and all computed parameters.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
SOBEK has a transparent ASCII database and can download information from a variety of standard data formats and GIS systems. The program is very easy to configure and quick to learn. It checks extensively for data input and schematization errors. The GIS oriented interface makes it more user-friendly than most other programs, especially for larger networks. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The integrated approach makes SOBEK a valuable instrument for flood forecasting, navigation, optimizing drainage systems, controlling irrigation systems, reservoir operation, sewer overflow design, ground water level control, river morphology regulation, and water quality control. The integrated approach also means that SOBEK can combine river systems, urban systems and rural systems for a total water management solution.</P>
<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Model methods include the following:</P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SOBEK-Rural gives regional water managers a high-quality tool for modeling irrigation systems, drainage systems, natural streams in lowlands and hilly areas. Applications are typically related to optimizing agricultural production flood control, irrigation, canal automation, reservoir operation, and water quality control. SOBEK-Rural can also answer questions about increased pollution loads in response to growing urbanization. SOBEK-Rural offers the support you need for effective planning, design and operation of new and existing water systems.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
The software calculates (easily, accurately and fast) the flow in simple or complex channel networks, consisting of thousands of reaches, cross sections and structures. All types of boundary conditions can be defined, as well as lateral inflow and outflow using time series or standard formulae. For more detail, the rainfall run-off process of urban areas and various types of unpaved areas can be modeled, taking into account land use, the unsaturated zone, groundwater, capillary rise and the interaction with water levels in open channels. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Based on the Delwaq- program</LI>
<LI>Models almost any water quality variable and its related water quality processes </LI>
<LI>Highly flexible due to the many standard options and user-defined options available </LI>
<LI>Uses a library of 600 processes and substances, including eutrophication, adsorption, desorption, nutrients, bacteria, oxygen, phyloplankton, heavy metals and micro-pollutants </LI>
<LI>The interactive processes editor allows selection of the water quality variables and processes required in the model </LI>
<LI>Pre-defined sets of water quality variables and processes can be used for particular problems or following the standard set of rules and regulations for specific regions</LI>
<LI>To analyse the origin of pollutants in any water system, fraction computations can be easily made. </LI>
<LI>No additional input data is required for fraction computations, which makes it easy to trace water or pollutants from to its source throughout the network</LI>
<LI>State-of-the-art numerical schemes use a finite volume approach and display mass balances </LI>
<LI>Fully integrated with the standard user interface, which means that standard network editing, animations, graphs and other post-processing facilities of SOBEK are used. </LI>
<LI>Automated link to the Sobek-urban product lines, which allows viewing of water quality in an integrated urban-rural context </LI>
<LI>The option to link your own ASCII input file with boundary data. </LI></UL>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SOBEK-River </P>
</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SOBEK-River is designed for simple and complex river systems and estuaries. It simulates the water flows, the water quality and morphological changes in river systems, estuaries and other types of alluvial channel networks. The networks can be branched or looped. SOBEK-River is able to work with complex cross-sectional profiles consisting of various sub-sections.</P>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sobek has been used for the Grand Prarie Irrigation project in Arkansas, urban flooding analysis in Surinam, an analysis of flooding on the Caparo river in Trinidad, an analysis of street flooding in Eindhoven, the Netherlands as well as several other applications.</P>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">SOBEK has a transparent ASCII database and can download information from a variety of standard data formats and GIS systems, so there's no need for extra typing. The program is very easy to configure and quick to learn. It checks extensively for data input and schematization errors. The GIS oriented interface makes it more user-friendly than most other programs, especially for larger networks. The computer screen can be adjusted automatically.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Animation options show the direction of flow through the network and by varying the thickness and colors of selected network elements, all input and computed parameters can be visualized. The network can also be viewed from the side. Sideview allows the user to watch the water profiles and real-time operation of structures in detail.</P>
